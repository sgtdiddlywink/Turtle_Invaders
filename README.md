# Turtle_Invaders
Python turtle game similar to space invaders. WIP

This is a WIP and will update.
Current list of items that need to be resolved:
1. Detect collision between shots and bunkers
2. Detect collision between invaders and bunkers
3. Have invaders shoot back
4. Need to increase speed with each level won

BUGS:
1. The turret's shot is always where at the x location of the turret when the shot hits the top boundary
2. The invader row starts to separate after it hits the left wall and grows.
3. The lives counter keeps dropping to zero after getting hit instead of resetting.
