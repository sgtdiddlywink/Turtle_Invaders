# Turtle_Invaders
Python turtle game similar to space invaders. WIP

This is a WIP and will update.
Current list of items that need to be resolved:
1. Detect collision between shots and invaders
2. Detect collision between shots and bunkers
3. Detect collision between invaders and bunkers
4. Detect collision between invaders and player
5. Update scoreboard after hitting invader
6. Remove lives when appropriate
7. End game when there are no lives left
8. Have invaders shoot back

BUGS:
1. The turret's shot is always where at the x location of the turret when the shot hits the top boundary
2. The invader row starts to separate after it hits the left wall and grows.
